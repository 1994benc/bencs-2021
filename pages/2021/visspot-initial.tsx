        <h2 className="heading-2">The problem with traditional UX research</h2>
        <p>
          There are various ways to conduct UX research. They usually involve
          intensive data collection, data processing, data analysis (including
          hypothesis testing using various statistical methods), and data
          visualisation (including putting charts into presentation slides).
          These tasks are often performed manually, and are difficult to be
          reproduced the same way everytime. They are also usually performed
          only once as they can be quite expensive and time-consuming. This has
          led to a lack of missing potential insights such as:

            <b>Scenario:</b> We’ve just created a new button on our web page.
            And we expect people to click it more than the old button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Testing:</b> A/B testing
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>We need:</b> users randomly split into 2 groups. Users in the
            first group will be presented with a version of our web page that
            has the new button, and the other group will only see the old
            button.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Traditional way to approach this:</b> collect usage data from the
            two groups, clean the data, and perform a statistical analysis. We
            may also have to come up with a few data visualisations to present
            the research result to our stakeholders, or just to understand our
            result better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s say we find that there is a significant difference between the
            users from the two groups. We create a PowerPoint presentation and
            present it to our stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>Then we forget about it.</p>
          <p>Do you see any problems with this approach?</p>
          <p>
            What If our new button only appeals to our users during Christmas
            time, which is when we conducted our research, but has a negative
            effect in the Summer? How can we make sure that this insight is not
            lost?

          This is one of the problems VisSpot could solve
        </h2>
        <p>
          By automating <b>continuous research pipelines</b>, making conducting
          research easier, more efficient, and truely repeatable.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl">What's a research pipeline?</h3>
        <p>
          A research pipeline consists of multiple <b>steps</b>. In the mock-up
          below, steps are represented as columns, and they can contain multiple{" "}
          <b>tasks</b>. For example, a data collection step contains a form for
          data entry, a data processing and analysing step contains various
          software agents that will clean, process, and perform hypothesis
          testing for us, and a data visualisation step contains data
          visualisers can automatically create any charts we need.
        </p>
        <div className="relative w-full h-96">
          <Image src={mockup.src} layout={"fill"} objectFit={"contain"} />
        </div>
        <p>
          To put it simply, VisSpot allows users (who don't need to know
          anything about programming) to create a way to continuously collect
          data and pipe it into a series of data processing tasks, and a series
          of visualisation tasks. The results could be saved into any storage of
          choice (Google Drive, OneDrive, local file system, etc.)
        </p>
        <h2 className="heading-2">Set up once and run multiple times</h2>
        <p>
          This research pipeline could be set up once and run multiple times.
          That’s why we call it a “continuous research pipeline”. You can
          schedule it to run based on any conditions you want. For example, you
          can ask your pipeline to run every Tuesday at 9AM, or every time we
          have 100 rows of data entered.
        </p>
        <h2 className="heading-2">Just an idea.</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, VisSpot is just an idea. The next step is to build a
          proof-of-concept. I will write down every step in my journey and post
          it here. Stay tuned!
